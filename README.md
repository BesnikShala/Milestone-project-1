# Prestige Automotive | Milestone Project 1

The website aims to target car enthusiasts and owners who are looking to modify or better their precious vehicle. The website aims to provide three main services which target the look 
and performance via a car wrapping service which consists of a material which is used to wrap over the car panels to change the colour and texture of the car. The second service consists
 of detailing which is a very focused form of cleaning the car both internally and externally. The third service is boost to the engines power, this is basically a computer chip which is coded
 specifically to the engine of the car to increasse the power output. The website will have a gallary and videos to showcase the services and also provide a form of contact to make enquiries. 
 The key aim is to attract more business by providing a showcase of services and also offering a method of enquiry which may be more convenient to clients via a form.

## Features Left to Implement
- The site will include a carousel of images for the services to browse through each one and view the service images.
-The site will include a form which is designed to make enquiries on price or even ask a question. 
-The site will also include a full gallary page where previous work can be viewed. 

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


# Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
